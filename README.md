#Spigot Builder CentOS
Installs a spigot server with some settings preconfigured by Thomas James
who is probably the most notorious minecraft dweeb at GCU, don't @ me

#Some important notes:
This program doesn't set your server to a static IP address, which is ideal for persistent installations, so make sure you use ifconfig to find/set your IP.
You need to set how much RAM your server is going to use manually, by default it starts with 2GB.
